Started on implementing game mechanics like opponent turn and keypressed, which is basically player turn while also fixing up on errors in the code. 

### Date: 5/30/24

Started on functions like drawBattle or finish keypressed. Error that says Pokemon class and Trainer class keeps popping up. Have to find out why later.
