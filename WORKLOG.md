# Work Log

## GROUP MEMBER 1: Manhai Liu

### Date: 5/29/24

Started on implementing game mechanics like opponent turn and keypressed, which is basically player turn while also fixing up on errors in the code. 

### Date: 5/30/24

Started on functions like drawBattle or finish keypressed. Error that says Pokemon class and Trainer class keeps popping up. Have to find out why later. 

### Date: 6/2/24 - 6/3/24

Worked on all the methods and functions and revised many of them. Had to rename a lot of the classes so it wouldn't conflict. Finally finished the project(albeit a little worrisome) after 4+ hrs of coding and not a lot of sleep.
